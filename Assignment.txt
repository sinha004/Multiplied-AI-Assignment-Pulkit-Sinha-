Interactive Dashboard for Near Miss Data Analysis

Objective

The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to work with real-world datasets, build a stable and interactive dashboard, demonstrate data visualization skills, and optionally apply AI/LLM capabilities for data-driven question answering.



Dataset Provided
- Format: JSON
- Size: Approximately 7,800 records
- Content: Near miss / incident-related structured data
The dataset will be shared with you at the start of the test.



Problem Statement

What is a Near Miss?
In a construction company, a near miss refers to an unplanned event that could have resulted in an accident, injury, or damage, but did not, either by chance or timely intervention.

For example: 

A worker slips on a wet surface but regains balance without falling,

A tool falls from a height but misses people below,

A vehicle stops just in time to avoid a collision


Using the provided Near Miss JSON dataset, build a dashboard application that:
1. Loads and processes the dataset (JSON to CSV conversion is allowed).
2. Displays meaningful visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, pie/donut charts, trend analysis, or category/severity distributions.
3. Ensures performance and stability – the app should not crash and should handle missing or empty data gracefully.
4. Provides a simple, clean, and readable user interface.

You are free to choose any frontend framework, backend , and charting library.



Tools & Technologies
You may use any programming language, framework, or AI tool. Use of AI tools (Cursor, AntiGravity, Chatgpt...) during development is allowed. Code quality and clarity matters.



Submission Instructions
Submit GitHub repository link (Public) for your project. The repository must include the complete source code, a README with setup instructions, and clearly stated assumptions or limitations. Paste the GitHub repository URL under the Solution Link section. 


Evaluation Criteria
- Data handling and correctness
- Quality and relevance of visualizations
- Application stability and performance
- Code quality and structure
- User experience


Expected Outcome
A working dashboard that effectively visualizes Near Miss data with atleast 5 charts or graphs



Important Submission Rules (Mandatory)
The following rules are strictly enforced and are extremely important:


You can submit your response only once through the Google Form. Multiple submissions are not allowed.

Only responses submitted using your official college email ID will be considered.

Late submissions beyond the specified deadline will not be accepted for evaluation.  

If two submissions are found to be identical, both entries will be disqualified.

The app, webpage, or service must be runnable, so that we can verify and view the results.

Failure to follow any of the above rules may result in disqualification.
